## KSU SSH

A mountless OpenSSH server for Android devices with KernelSU or APatch.

> **Credits:** This project is a fork of [MagiskSSH](https://gitlab.com/d4rcm4rc/MagiskSSH) by **D4rCM4rC and Contributors**

Main changes from upstream:
  - Mountless: binaries in `/data/adb/ssh`, no system partition mounts
  - Password authentication
  - Requires KernelSU or APatch (Magisk not supported)

An SSH server for Android devices having KernelSU / APatch
========================================================================

This is a fully functional system-daemon-like SSH server for Android devices.

Its core is a version of OpenSSH modified to be usable on Android. It also includes rsync. It is available for arm, arm64, x86, and x86_64 architectures.

This repository is a collection of build scripts for building an installable KSU/APatch module. It cannot be installed itself.

It requires Android API version 24 or higher (Android 7.0 Nougat and higher).

## Download and Install

Pre-built ZIPs are available from the releases page. Further hints for installation, configuration and usage can be found in [the module's README.md](module_data/README.md).

You don't trust me and don't want to use binaries I compiled? No problem! Just head to [How To Build](#how-to-build), grab the source code, check it and compile it yourself.

## Used Packages and Included Resources

* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)
* [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
* [Magisk Module Installer](https://github.com/topjohnwu/magisk-module-installer) (installer format shared by KernelSU and APatch; Magisk itself is unsupported)

Some changes to OpenSSH are used from [Arachnoid's SSHelper](https://arachnoid.com/android/SSHelper/).

## How To Build

    <clone or download>
    cd <source dir>
    mkdir build
    cd build
    make -f ../all_arches.mk -j8 zip

A zip file will be created in the build-directory. It can be copied to the Android device and installed via the KSU or APatch manager app.

On my i7-6700k a full build using all cores takes about 4 minutes.
The Android-NDK path is set to `/opt/android-ndk` per default. It can be changed by passing `ANDROID_ROOT=/path/to/ndk` to make or exporting it:

    ...
    export ANDROID_ROOT=/path/to/ndk
    make -f ../all_arches.mk -j8 zip

## Build Dependencies

* Recent GNU/Linux system on amd64
* Make. Only tested using GNU Make 4.4.1
* Wget. Only tested using GNU Wget 1.25.0
* Android NDK. Only tested using version r25c
* Python3. Only tested using Python 3.13.3
* 7z (or zip as fallback). Only tested 17.05

Newer versions generally should work. Older versions may work or may not.

## Version bumping OpenSSL and rsync

A version bump for these two packages is pretty straightforward:

- Enter the new version in openssl.mk or rsync.mk
- these commands will download and generate checksums for each package:
  - `make -f all_arches.mk update_openssl_with_tofu`
  - `make -f all_arches.mk update_rsync_with_tofu`
- Update the module version and go through the checklist
- Delete build and src directories and rebuild the whole module

## Version bumping OpenSSH

A version bump for OpenSSH is more difficult. Basically, the same steps as for OpenSSL and rsync are required.
OpenSSH however also needs a patch which is different for every version.
To generate one for a new version do this:

- Unpack the new version's source to a directory twice (ie. `tar xzf openssh-version.tar.gz; mv openssh-version a; cp -a a b`)
- Try to apply the patch to b, it will not patch without issues (`cd b; patch -p1 < path/to/previous.patch`)
- Fix all errors and warnings
- Remove the pre-patch backups and reject files
- Possibly add more changes. Candidates are:
  - Calls to getpwnam
  - Calls to getpwuid
  - Direct uses of /tmp as path for temporary files
- Generate a new patch (`diff -urN a b > path/to/new.patch`)
- Try to build the module. If not possible, fix errors and generate a new patch

## Checklist for a new version

- All packages have the correct version
- For all updated packages checksum files have been generated
- A new version is entered in module_data/module.prop under both `version` and `versionCode`
- The module_data/README.md is updated to include the new package versions
- An entry in the changelog in module_data/README.md is added

Then we can create a full build (delete _build_ directory first), upload it to
the releases repository and update the update.json in here.
